Woohoo my blog is up and running. At first I thought it would be quite a hassle to setup but in the end it turned out to be extremely simple.

All I had to do is go to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and follow the steps there. In just a few minutes you are up and running!

Kudos to all the guys contributing to that repo! Really helped me alot.


## So what now?
All I now have to do is come up with some nice topics to blog about. Thinking of mainly programming related post but maybe Ill throw in some photography (which is a hobby of mine) related posts in as well.
