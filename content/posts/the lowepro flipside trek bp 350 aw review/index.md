## Intro
I needed a bigger more comfortable backpack than my Lowepro Slingshot Edge 250 AW. After some research I came accross the Lowepro Flipside Trek BP 350 AW backpack and decided to buy it as it strikes a nice balance between carrying camera gear and being able to carry some other stuff such as clothes. This is quite a useful feature when traveling with a single backpack. Having used the backpack during a trip to the Sahara in Morocco where I could only bring my backpack to the desert I can confirm this is a excellent backpack well worth the money.

## Overview
The Lowepro Flipside Trek comes in 3 different sizes which you can recognize by the number. The 250 is the smallest, 350 sits in the middle and the 450 is the biggest. In my case I went for the 350 as this was big enough for my mirrorless camera and lenses. I believe other than size the bags are pretty much similar in terms of features.

Speaking of features this backpack has quite alot:
- Camera section that can fit a camera with attached lens (a 70-200 should fit) and some additional lenses. In my case I could put my Tamron 17-28 F2.8, Tamron 28-75 F2.8 and my sony 85mm F1.8 in here with one of these attached to my camera. You can rearrange this section to your wishes as bag comes with plenty of Velcro sections.
- General purpose section.
- Tablet section, I don't have a tablet but I used this to store some extra clothing.
- Can comfortably carry a decently sized tripod (mine weights around 1.5kg)
- One of the few bags with 2 water bottle holders (these could also hold a small tripod or other stuff)
- Chest and hip support but also a vented back panel for extra comfort. You can carry this bag all day if you want.
- The bag is padded and quite sturdy to protect your gear but also your back.
- Flipside access allowing you to access your camera without setting down the bag on the ground.
